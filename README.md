# Afrobeats Quiz
* **Introduction**

**Afrobeats** is best defined as music **Out of Africa**. Conceived in the late 1960s by the Nigerian artist and activist Fela Anikulapo-Kuti as a protest music that spoke truth to power, Afrobeats has been reimagined (and now pluralised as Afrobeats) by a new generation of music artists across the continent of Africa: _Burna Boy, Master KG, Whizkid, Nonzus Magnus, P-Square, Angelique Kidjo, Davido, Shatta Wale_, and many others, as an eclectic mixture of West African Afropop and South African Afro-house, stretching further beyond the confines of Africa to include western rap, Afroswing/Afro bashment, dancehall, R&B, and EDM.
