# Afrobeats Quiz
* **Introduction**

**Afrobeats** is best defined as music **Out of Africa**. Conceived in the late 1960s by the Nigerian artist and activist Fela Anikulapo-Kuti as a protest music that spoke truth to power, **Afrobeat** (singular) has been reimagined (and now pluralised as **Afrobeats**) by a new generation of music artists across the continent of Africa: Burna Boy, Master KG, Whizkid, Nonzus Magnus, P-Square, Angelique Kidjo, Davido, Shatta Wale, and many others, as an eclectic mixture of West African Afropop and South African Afro-house, stretching further beyond the confines of African continent to include UK/Ireland Afroswing/Afro bashment, Afro-Reggaeton, western rap, dancehall, R&B, and EDM.

There was a time African music was essentially local, now with Afrobeats the world is its centre stage: from sold-out gigs at London’s 02 Arena to full house performances in Madison Square Garden New York City. From making strong showing in Billboard global charts and spending 86 weeks in the UK Official Chart Top 40 to scoping Grammys, BET, and other major international music awards. You will find **An Garda Síochána** (Irish police force) dancing to “Jerusalema”; Justine Biber vibing in pidgin English; and Janet Jackson miming “you want bam bam, you want to sing with the big boys”, a hook from Goya Menor and Nektunez’s “Ameno Amapiano.” Listening and dancing to African music is now cool!

This global affirmation of Afrobeats is exemplified in the collaboration of international music super stars with African music artists: Rick Ross with P-Square, Wale with Wizkid, Kanye West with D'Banj, Maluma with Maître Gimz, Ed Sheeran with Fireboy, and Sam Smith with Burna Boy. In 2019, Beyoncé collaborated with 9 African music artists for her soundtrack album “The Lion King: The Gift,” revealing to **Good Morning America** that "I wanted it to be authentic to what is beautiful about the music in Africa."
